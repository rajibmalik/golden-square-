## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want a program that I can add todo tasks to and see a list of them.

As a user
So that I can focus on tasks to complete
I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

class TaskTracker
  def initializer
  end 
  
  def add(task) # task is a string representing instructions 
  end
  
  def list # returns a list of the tasks that have been added
  # fails if there are no tasks added to the list
  end
  
  def complete(task) # `completes` a task that has been added 
  # Fails if the task does not exist in the task list 
todo_list.list => ["Clean room"]

# 3 Adding multiple tasks 

task_tracker = TaskTracker.new 
todo_list.add("Clean room")
todo_list.add("Clean car")
todo_list.list => ["Clean room", "Clean car"]

# 4 Completing a task 

task_tracker.complete("Clean car")
task_tracker.list => fails "No such task"


## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
